## Operators. If statement

### Task Description

Your task involves using Java operators and `if` statements to work with integer variables and perform various calculations. You will be using IntelliJ IDEA and the results will be submitted via GitHub Classroom.

### Objectives

1. **Initialize Variables**:
    - Declare four `int` variables.
    - Initialize them with random values using `Math.random()`. Example:
      ```java
      int randomNum = (int) (Math.random() * 100);
      ```

2. **Find Maximum Value**:
    - Using an `if-else` statement, determine the maximum value among the four variables.
    - Print the maximum value to the console.

3. **Find Minimum Value**:
    - Using an `if-else` statement, determine the minimum value among the four variables.
    - Print the minimum value to the console.

4. **Determine Parity of Maximum Value**:
    - Check if the maximum value is even or odd.
    - Print the information to the console.

5. **Determine Parity of Minimum Value**:
    - Check if the minimum value is even or odd.
    - Print the information to the console.

6. **Calculate and Display Product Squared**:
    - Calculate the product of the maximum and minimum values.
    - Square the result and print it to the console.

7. **Result of Division Without Fractional Part**:
    - Divide the maximum value by the minimum value.
    - Print the result to the console without the fractional part.
